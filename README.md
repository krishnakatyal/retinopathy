# Retinopathy

Millions of people suffer from diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among working aged adults.
Detecting Diabetic Retinopathy is a time-consuming and manual process that requires a trained clinician to examine and evaluate digital color fundus photographs of the retina. 

Diabetic retinopathy is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the tissue at the back of the eye (retina). Poorly controlled blood sugar is a risk factor.
